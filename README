Machine Learning Final Project README!

=====================================

We'll make this as quick as possible. Yes, you can run our code without
any external libraries besides the CLI library.

The Data:
All data for running code is found in data/unsupervised and data/supervised
For the neural net, use data from data/supervised
For the K-means clusters, use data from data/unsupervised
Those files with the first letter being 'H' are healthy
Those files with the first letter being 'm' are tumored

To compile:
> Go to src/ directory
$ ./compile.sh

There are two algorithms: A neural network and a k-means cluster

Running the neural net:
> Still in src/ directory
$ java cs475.Classify -healthy_data <healthy_file> -tumor_data <tumor_file(s)> -sgd_eta0 <learning rate> -num_trials <num_trials> 

-tumor_data argument can take multiple files for testing. This can be done by the folowing: -tumor_data <file_one>:<file_two>:....

-num_trials if not used is automatically set to 20. We recommend changing this to 1 if you just want to see the classification accuracy.

Running the K-means clustering:
> Still in src/ directory
$ java cs475.KCluster.KClusterTester -alpha <a> -clusters <c> -gd_convergence <conv> -gd_iterations <itr> -init_random <r> -testing <test> -data <healthy_file>

-alpha controls the probability distribution for assigning a points in the initial clustering phase. Automatically set to 1.0

-clusters controls the number of clusters to use. Automatically set to 5.

-gd_convergence controls the convergence criteria. Automatically set to 1e-5.

-gd_iterations controls the number of iterations to use. If set to -1 will run until convergence. This won't take more then 100 iterations.

-init_random controls whether or not the first cluster is randomely selected. If 1, this is true. If 0, will choose the first point as the cluster center.

-testing determines whether or not to test on the tumor dataset. If 1, will test on all tumor datasets. If 0, will only test on the healthy dataset
